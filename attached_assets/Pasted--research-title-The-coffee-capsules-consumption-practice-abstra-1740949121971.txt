      "abstract": "Changes in consumer behavior and his constant search for convenience and practicality in products and services stimulated the demand for coffee capsules, a fast growing market in Brazil. However, little is known about consumer behavior and preferences regarding this product, motivating this study. Our aim was to understand the coffee capsules consumption through the lens of the Theory of Practice, in order to analyze the specificities that structure this market and guide the behavior of its consumers. Through a qualitative and descriptive study, supported by the conduction of semi-structured interviews and participant observation in virtual groups of these product’s consumers, we found that the consumption of encapsulated coffees is conditioned to the disposition of time and company of the interviewees and that the product’s quality perception is still low. In addition, there is great resistance to the acquisition and consumption of generic capsules.",

      "abstract": "Background: Caffeine is known to inhibit phosphodiesterases, to mobilise intracellular calcium, and to act as an antagonist at adenosine receptors, all of which can potentially alter nitric oxide (NO) production. It was therefore hypothesised that caffeine may alter exhaled NO (eNO) levels. Methods: In a randomised, single blind, crossover manner, 12 normal subjects consumed either (1) coffee and a placebo capsule, (2) decaffeinated coffee and a capsule of 200 mg caffeine, or (3) decaffeinated coffee and a placebo capsule. Serum caffeine levels were measured at baseline and 1 hour later. Exhaled NO levels were also measured at baseline and each hour for 4 hours. Results: A significant percentage fall in mean (SE) eNO from baseline was seen 1 hour after either caffeinated coffee or a caffeine capsule when compared with placebo (13.5 (4.0)%, p=0.009 and 19.0 (3.8)%, p=0.001, respectively). Conclusion: Caffeine causes a significant decrease in eNO which will need to be considered when designing trials to measure eNO levels. The mechanism may be via adenosine receptor antagonism or by altering levels of cGMP.",

      "abstract": "In a residential research ward the reinforcing and subjective effects of caffeine were studied under double‐blind conditions in volunteer subjects with histories of heavy coffee drinking. In Experiment 1, 6 subjects had 13 opportunities each day to self‐administer either a caffeine (100 mg) or a placebo capsule for periods of 14 to 61 days. All subjects developed a clear preference for caffeine, with intake of caffeine becoming relatively stable after preference had been attained. Preference for caffeine was demonstrated whether or not preference testing was preceded by a period of 10 to 37 days of caffeine abstinence, suggesting that a recent history of heavy caffeine intake (tolerance/dependence) was not a necessary condition for caffeine to function as a reinforcer. In Experiment 2, 6 subjects had 10 opportunities each day to self‐administer a cup of coffee or (on different days) a capsule, dependent upon completing a work requirement that progressively increased and then decreased over days. Each day, one of four conditions was studied: caffeinated coffee (100 mg/cup), decaffeinated coffee, caffeine capsules (100 mg/capsule), or placebo capsules. Caffeinated coffee maintained the most self‐administration, significantly higher than decaffeinated coffee and placebo capsules but not different from caffeine capsules. Both decaffeinated coffee and caffeine capsules were significantly higher than placebo capsules but not different from each other. In both experiments, subject ratings of “liking” of coffee or capsules covaried with the self‐administration measures. These experiments provide the clearest demonstrations to date of the reinforcing effects of caffeine in capsules and in coffee.",

We investigated the volatilome of four different polypropylene coffee capsule typologies (Biologico, Dolce, Deciso, Guatemala) with and without capsules in order to reveal the possible differences in the VOCs spectra. The volatilome of each one was singularly studied through an analysis by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC–MS), checking the abundance of different VOCs in coffee extracted with and without a capsule protection and compared to its related sample. Furthermore, ANOVA and Tukey tests were applied to statistically identify and individuate the possible differences. As a result, it was found that coffee capsules, offer advantages of protecting coffee from oxidation or rancidity and, consequently extended shelf life as well as did not cause a reduction of volatile compounds intensity. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that the aroma of polypropylene coffee capsule extraction is not damaged compared to a traditional espresso.",

The polylaminate materials that compose most popular capsules make them a type of waste that is difficult to manage and recycle. This paper analyses the scientific references that deal with studying and improving the management processes of waste coffee capsules, as well as the studies that have analysed their environmental impact. Through a bibliographic review, some encouraging aspects emerged in the recovery of materials that can be adequately recycled (plastics and metals), as well as their possible use for the production of biogas and energy recovery. The need to manually separate the components that make up the capsule still represents one of the main challenges. Many efforts are still needed to favour the environmental sustainability of this waste from a strategic, technological and consumer empowerment point of view.",

Four types of brews, with five preparation replications, were evaluated.   The capsules had differences in the amount and type of roasted and ground coffees used (blends of arabica and robusta coffee or 100% arabica coffee), and in the conditions of time and volume of extraction (dose) recommended by the manufacturer.   The coffee brews presented 1.42 and 4.88 g of solids/100 mL. Concentration of solids decreased with the increase in time/volume extraction.   Contents of 0.47 to 1.04 mg of kahweol and 0.38 to 0.92 mg of cafestol by dose (ranging from 35 to 120 mL) were observed. These contents corresponded to a range of 0.40 to 2.96 mg of kahweol/100 mL   and 0.32 to 2.62 mg of cafestol/100 mL. The fraction of diterpenes extracted varied from 1.85 to 4.27 % for kahweol and 1.87 to 4.16 % for cafestol.   Considering the contents of cafestol, there is no indication of a hypercholesterolemic effect due to a moderate consumption of coffee brews prepared from these commercial capsules.",

The sewage from the pre-treatment phase of the wastewater treatment plant of the Federal University of Lavras fed the system. Temperature, pH, alkalinity and volatile acids concentration, COD, TS, TVS and TSS of the influent and effluent were analyzed to evaluate the reactors performances. Statistics tests were run in the software Statistica 10. Changes occurred in the organic loading rates caused two different operating phases, one at an OLR of 2.1 kg COD m-3d-1 and another at 4.0 kg COD m-3d-1. The average temperature during the monitoring period was 18°C. In spite of the operating conditions variations, the reactors showed satisfactory performances, presenting COD efficiency removals up to 80% in both phases. The capsules characteristics were similar to other materials used as support. Hence, it is possible to utilize coffee capsules as support material in anaerobic reactors, providing satisfactory pollutants removal efficiencies.",

Proponents of coffee enemas claim that the cafestol palmitate in coffee enhances the activity of glutathione S-transferase, an enzyme that stimulates bile excretion. During video capsule endoscopy (VCE), excreted bile is one of the causes of poor preparation of the small bowel. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and effect of coffee enema for preparation of the small bowel during VCE. In this pilot study, 17 of 34 patients were assigned to the coffee enema plus polyethylene glycol (PEG) 2 L ingestion group, whereas the 17 remaining control patients received 2 L of PEG only. The quality of bowel preparation was evaluated in the two patient groups. Bowel preparations in the proximal segments of small bowel were not differ between two groups. In the mid and distal segments of the small intestine, bowel preparations tend to be better in patients who received coffee enemas plus PEG than in patients who received PEG only. The coffee enema group did not experience any complications or side effects. Coffee enemas may be a feasible option, and there were no clinically significant adverse events related to coffee enemas. More prospective randomized studies are warranted to improve small bowel preparation for VCE.",

Estrogenic chemical content was determined using ultra-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. All capsule coffee samples possessed estrogenic activity (48-56%RME2). EEFs were 6-7 orders of magnitude lower than that of E2, (1.2 × 10-7-1.7 × 10-6), indicating substantially weaker estrogenic potencies. Bisphenol A, bisphenol F, benzophenone, 4-nonylphenol, dibutyl phthalate, and dimethyl terephthalate were detected in capsule coffee. Capsule coffee exhibited estrogenic activity in vitro, and its estrogenic chemical content is likely driving its estrogenicity, warranting further investigations to fully understand the degree to which they are related and to predict the estrogenic potential based on the concentration of estrogenic chemicals.",

Here, the antifungal activity of ethanolic SCG extract from caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee capsules was evaluated against yeasts and filamentous fungi. These extracts had antifungal activity against Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and Trichophyton rubrum, all skin fungal agents. Moreover, SCG had fungicidal activity against T. mentagrophytes and T. rubrum. To understand the underlying mechanisms of the antifungal activity, fungal cell membrane and cell wall components were quantified. SCG caused a significant reduction of the ergosterol, chitin, and β-(1,3)-glucan content of C. parapsilosis, revealing the synthesis of this membrane component and cell wall components as possible targets of these extracts. These extracts were cytotoxic for the tumoral cell lines tested but not for the non-tumoral PLP2 cell line. The analysis of the phenolic compounds of these extracts revealed the presence of caffeoylquinic acid, feruloylquinic acid, and caffeoylshikimic acid derivatives. Overall, this confirmed the antifungal activity of spent coffee grounds, presenting a potential increase in the sustainability of the life cycle of coffee grounds, as a source for the development of novel antifungal formulations, especially for skin or mucosal fungal infections.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The aim of this work is to analyze, by means of CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics), the gas flow in a packaging machine used to fill polymeric capsules with coffee. The final goal is to optimize the geometric shape of some mechanical components in the machine’s sealing station in order to reduce the inert gas consumption achieving an O 2 residual which is constantly equal or below 1 % by mass in the center of the capsule. The fluid domain has been obtained starting from the 3D CAD model of the sealing station of the packaging machine. The CAD software SolidWorks has been used to design the system, while Ansys CFX 14.5 software has been used for the CFD analysis. The CFD model has been validated by comparing its results with those obtained by experimental tests. The modified solution allows reducing the average O 2 residual from about 3 % to less than 1 %.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Coffee is among the most appreciated beverages by consumers globally. Single serve coffee market expands and is highly profitable, but coffee in capsules (CIC) raises a major issue of environmental sustainability. The coffee industry aims to expand the CIC sales and to reduce capsule environmental impact and waste. To better define a sustainability-oriented strategy, the coffee industry needs to understand how to approach different socio-economic consumer groups. Thus, this study aims to explore consumers' perception and awareness of sustainable CIC, with specific attention on consumers' socio-economic characteristics. Methods The study interviewed a sample of 261 Italian consumers. Data elaboration includes four main steps: a cluster analysis leading to three socio-economic groups, a factor and structural equation modeling to confirm the factors and the relation between CIC sustainability and quality factors, and a multinomial logistic regression to examine the factors that drive the likeliness of consumers' willingness to purchase sustainable CIC. Results Results support that all groups of consumers value sustainability attribute as main CIC purchasing decision driver. The sustainability factor does not show any significance on the explanation of the CIC quality factor. Consumer perception of the CIC sustainability is not affected by age, income, level of education, and gender. Conclusion This study provides preliminary insights for sustainable CIC production and consumption.",

In this context, the present study aims to assess the repairability level of small electrical and electronic appliances, specifically focusing on capsule coffee machines, taking the EN 45554 standard (General methods for the assessment of the ability to repair, reuse, and upgrade energy-related products) as a reference. To achieve this objective, an interpretation of the standard is made with the aim of developing a repair matrix to facilitate the calculation of the repair index. The repair matrix is customised to the case study of capsule coffee machines. Following its application with four existing capsule coffee machines and having obtained their corresponding repair indexes, design requirements to improve the repairability of this product category are identified and applied in the design of a new capsule coffee machine with a higher (better) repair index. After this process, various improvement options for the repair matrix that enhance the accuracy of the EN 45554 requirements are discussed and applied, and finally compared with the Repairability assessment methodology (AsMeR).",

Matrix-matched calibration showed good linearity with determination coefficients (R2) higher than 0.9983 for all analytes and matrices. In general, matrix effect assessment revealed a medium effect of signal suppression, while mean relative recovery values were in the range 70-120% with relative standard deviation values ≤19% for most analytes.

Tablet l-T4 malabsorption results from either hindered gastric dissolution of the tablet or binding of l-T4 by sequestrants in the intestinal lumen.Areas covered: This review provides an overview of the pharmacokinetics of l-T4 formulations available in the market: the tablet, the soft gel capsule and the oral solution. We review literature on the new formulations and anticipate the areas of future research.Expert opinion: Failure of l-T4 treatment to reach target serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels generally prompts the physicians to increase l-T4 daily dose. In vitro studies have shown that the soft gel capsule releases the active ingredient more consistently at varying pH than the tablet. In addition, in vivo studies have confirmed the in vitro data and have demonstrated that both the soft gel capsule and the liquid formulation are capable to solve tablet l-T4 malabsorption caused by certain drugs, bariatric surgery or coffee. These new formulations may be attractive also for patients who cannot/do not want to change their (improper) habits of l-T4 ingestion. Finally, the oral solution l-T4 could be suitable for patients who cannot swallow the solid formulations.",

With an emphasis on the business model and value proposition, a conceptual solution was developed to promote the circularity of the capsule chain based on the analysis of the main stakeholders' needs. The value proposition of the PSS solution for the issue of coffee capsules was described as the “cocreation of sustainable value to stakeholders to foster the circularity of the chain”, considering consumer involvement through education and rewards in product disposal processes. The results reinforce the need to integrate critical stakeholders to add the desired value in creating a sustainable PSS solution and the need to pivot the business model during the solution development process.",

This paper aims to investigate the impacts of the Attributes of coffees in capsules on the consequences perceived by consumers concerning their consumption and the effects of these Consequences on consumers’ Values. Design/methodology/approach This study developed a scale for assessing the perception of consumers of coffee in capsules about Attributes, Consequences and Values (A-C-V) regarding its consumption. A link to this survey’s electronic questionnaire was posted on the social networks Facebook and Peabirus. This research sample is for convenience and accessibility and has 213 consumers of coffee in capsules. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was the statistical method used for data analysis. Findings Attributes have two sub-dimensions (Own attributes and Functional attributes), while Consequences have three sub-dimensions (Handling Benefits, Rational Benefits, Convenience Benefits) and Values have just one dimension. Also, SEM has shown a statistically significant positive relationship between A-C-V perceived by consumers of coffee in capsules. These results confirm the hypotheses developed based on the Means-End Chain Theory (MEC). Originality/value As academic contributions, this paper develops a structural model that quantitatively demonstrates the impacts of Attributes perceived by consumers of coffee in capsules on the Consequences of consumption and its effects on their Values. The present survey is the first in the literature that uses structural models contemplating A-C-V. As managerial contributions, this survey provides relevant information to the decision-making of several stakeholders of the chain of coffee in capsules.",

Given the worsening extent of climate change, coffee crop yields are harder to maintain, while demand is increasing. The 2021 Brazil frost delaying or destroying many coffee crops is an example. Hence, the incidence of coffee fraud is expected to increase, and as the market becomes more complex, there needs to be faster, easier, and more robust means of real-time coffee authentication. In this study, we propose the use of novel approaches to postcolumn derivatization (termed herein as in-column derivatization) to visualize the antioxidant profiles of coffee samples, to be later used as indicators for authentication purposes. We propose three simple mathematical similarity metrics for the real-time identification of unknown coffee samples from a sample library. Using the CUPRAC assay, and these metrics, we demonstrate the capabilities of the technique to identify unknown coffee samples from within our library of thirty.",

The chemical composition of coffee can undergo quality decay phenomena during storage, especially in terms of lipidic and volatile components. Amongst coffee packaging, aluminum multilayer materials are particularly widely diffused. However, aluminum is a negative component because it is not recoverable in a mixed plastic structure and its specific weight gives significant weight to packaging. In this study, a multilayer film with a reduced content of aluminum was used to package coffe pods and capsules and compared to a standard film with an aluminum layer. Their influence on the peroxides and volatile organic compounds of two coffee blends, 100% Coffea arabica L., 50% Coffea arabica L., and 50% Coffea canephora var. robusta L., were studied during their 180-day shelf life. The predominant volatile organic compounds detected belonged to the class of furans and pyrazines. Both packaging materials used for both coffee blends in the pods and capsules showed no significant differences during storage. Thus, the alternative packaging with less aluminum had the same performance as the standard with the advantage of being more sustainable, reducing the packaging weight, with benefits for transportation, and preserving the coffee aroma during the shelf life.",

In this research, three ways of extracting and two varieties of 100% Arabica were compared. Nineteen bars and fifteen bars were applied to the coffee thanks to the use of compatible capsules and machines. The method with the moka was considered, which acts at low pressures and does not allow the formation of foam (crema). In addition, the Brazil and Guatemala Arabica varieties were considered to understand the extent to which Arabica coffee can respond in structural and sensorial terms to the extraction techniques applied. The results show that 19-bar espresso coffees have a very stable crema with very small bubbles, which give a uniform and fine structure to the coffee crema. On the contrary, the pressure at 15 bars generates more unstable foams and bubbles that tend to be disproportionate, with more marked effects in the Brazil variety. The sensory profiles of the coffees respond to the extraction techniques applied. While the coffee extracted with the moka has sensory descriptors with rather low values, those obtained at 19 and 15 bars have much wider profiles. In conclusion, different pressure intensities to the coffee extraction affect the quality of crema and the solubilization of organoleptically active compounds.",

The intention was to include 57 participants in the coffee group, 61 in the chewing gum group and 60 in the control group, on 8 participants data were missing. A total of 165 participants were included in a per protocol analysis. Exclusion was due to not receiving the allocated intervention (8 coffee, 4 chewing gum) and technical failure of the capsule (1 coffee). The excretion rate was 58% in the coffee group (n = 48), 63% in the chewing gum group (n = 57) and 55% in the control group (n = 60, p > 0.2). Transit times were similar in all groups. The excretion rate was low in participants who had transit times over 10 h (14%). A strong correlation was found between adequate cleansing and excretion of the capsule. There were no serious adverse events related to the interventions or CCE investigations. Chewing gum and coffee did not improve excretion rate in this study. An effect of chewing gum could not be proven, possibly due to sample size. Since chewing gum might improve excretion rates, is cheap and has no known side effects, it needs to be considered in future bowel preparation trials for CCE.

Coffee consumption increases from year to year, which makes its functional property a relevant issue. The present research featured the antioxidant component in freeze-dried coffee and coffee capsules obtained from a commercial network. The main objective was to identify the most advantageous types of coffee to serve as a raw material for extract production. Coffee is known to prevent diseases caused by the oxidative action of free radicals. The paper presents a review of multiple scientific sources on the beneficial properties of coffee. It also features some results of the study in the chemical composition of coffee, i.e. dry matter content, phenols, flavonoids, etc. The anti-radical activity was described with the help of the DPPH method, while the FRAP method was employed to study the antioxidant properties of several coffee samples. The samples of instant coffee and coffee capsules were obtained from a distribution network (Samara, Russia) and included such brands as Coffea Premium, Coffesso, Nescafe Dolche Gusto, Jacobs Milicano, Bushido, Egoiste, and Fresco. Coffea Premium and Coffesso showed the best results in all the tests and can be additional sources of antioxidant substances. These two varieties of coffee capsules are produced for capsule coffee machines and are roasted ground coffee beans. Coffea Premium demonstrated the best results in phenolic substances, flavonoids, and anti-radical activity with 1338 mg of gallic acid and 854 mg of catechin per 100g of the original substance and 0.84 mg per cm3. Nescafe Dolche Gusto coffee capsules and such varieties of instant coffee as Jacobs Millicano, and Fresco showed similar but average results according to all the phenolic analyzes. Bushido and Egoiste were found lacking in phenols, flavonoids, and dry substances. These samples demonstrated low values of antiradiation and regenerating ability, which indicates a worse quality than that of coffee capsules. This may be due to some processing peculiarities: instant coffee undergoes thermal treatment when coffee granules are formed, while solvents are used to obtain coffee extract. Thus, the research revealed that Coffea Premium and Coffesso are the best sources of antioxidants.",

      "title": "Environmental impacts of different methods of coffee preparation",
      "abstract": "Abstract The environmental impacts of coffee consumption inter alia depend on the preparation method used by consumers. Preparation methods such as filter drip, pod machines and fully automatic coffee machines are the most common ones in Germany: 62% of the consumers use a filter drip machine to brew their coffee, 23% use filter pad machines and 15% use espresso machines such as fully automatic coffee machines or capsule systems. The aim of the different studies presented in this paper was to identify the critical environmental issues along the life cycle of coffee and to compare the different preparation methods of coffee regarding their influence on the environmental impacts. Within the Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) Pilot Project Germany, the PCF of one cup of a special type of coffee was analysed on behalf of Tchibo GmbH (Überseering, Hamburg, Germany). As the results show, the preparation by the consumer is one crucial part of the entire life cycle of coffee, making up a share of 30% of the overall emissions. Another hot spot is the cultivation of coffee beans with 55%. Concerning the use phase, research shows that environmental impacts vary significantly depending on the preparation method used by the consumer. Main drivers are differences in power consumption of the respective technologies. Furthermore, different packagings of the coffee play a decisive role. Comparing the analysed appliances and defined usage scenarios in this study, the French press and filter drip machine performed best, followed by the filter pad machine. In contrast, the environmental impacts of the analysed fully automatic coffee machine and the capsule machine were highest. The reason for this was the high power consumption, especially in the machines' sleep and standby mode. Additionally, capsule machines contribute to the environmental impacts because of the aluminium and/or plastic packaging of the capsules, automatic coffee machines because of their cleaning and rinsing programmes. The detailed results indicate a significant savings potential in the use phase. The impacts not only depend on the specific energy efficiency of the chosen appliance but also on the usage behaviour.",
